# âš¡ Auto Form Filler (with Gemini AI)

This is a **Chrome Extension** that intelligently auto-fills web forms using Gemini AI. It collects input field IDs and their associated labels (questions), sends them to Gemini for context-aware answers, and automatically fills in the inputs with the returned responses.

## How It Works

1. The extension collects all `<input>` field IDs and their corresponding `<label>` text (question).
2. It sends this data to **Gemini AI** to generate context-appropriate answers.
3. The extension receives the AI-generated answers and maps them back to the respective input fields using their IDs.
4. It uses `chrome.scripting.executeScript` to fill each field automatically.
